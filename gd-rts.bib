	abstract = {The framework for virtual integration of laboratories enables co-simulation and joint experiments that include hardware and software resources hosted at geographically distributed laboratories. The underlying concept of such framework is geographically distributed real-time (RT) co-simulation. To this end, digital RT simulators are interfaced over long distances via shared communication network such as the Internet. This study proposes an architecture for a modular framework supporting virtual integration of laboratories that enable flexible integration of digital RT simulators across Europe. In addition, the framework includes an interface that enables access for third parties via a web browser. A co-simulation interface algorithm adopted in this study is based on representation of interface quantities in form of dynamic phasors. Time delay between RT digital simulators is compensated by means of phase shift that enables simulation fidelity for slow transients. The proposed architecture is realised for the integration of laboratories across Europe that are located at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, Politecnico di Torino in Italy and at European Commission Joint Research Centres in Petten, Netherland and in Ispra, Italy. The framework for virtual integration of laboratories presented in this study is applied for co-simulation of transmission and distribution systems.},

This contribution outlines necessary requirements for the implementation of PHIL simulations, which are defined by the nature of the digital real-time simulator, the power amplifier, and the power interface (PI). Fundamental characteristics, such as the input/output systems, PI, interface algorithm, and system stability considerations, are discussed for PHIL setups, in order to illustrate both flexibility and complexity of this compound simulation method.

In a steady-state, the dynamic phasors reduce to standard phasors from AC circuit theory. We performed experiments and simulations involving a three-phase induction motor and a three-phase synchronous permanent magnet motor, and we demonstrate that models based on dynamic phasors provide very accurate descriptions of observed transients.

To solve this problem, most of the studies connect distinct simulators to create a novel co-simulation framework for ITDS. In this study, the authors present a literature survey of existing ITDS co-simulation frameworks along co-optimisation in ITDS. These frameworks are categorised on multiple characteristics, such as simulation tools, synchronisation methods, and research topics. Furthermore, they propose a software platform that is focused on the integrated generation, transmission, distribution, and customer systems (IGTDCSs). The proposed framework also comprises several technological dimensions such as stochastic optimisation, high-performance computing, and high-level design software architecture for planning integrated and flexible power networks and optimising their technological trajectories and operational functioning considering uncertainties. By developing a prototype informed with software engineering and complex system design approaches, they will demonstrate the relevance of a unified vision of IGTDCS simulation in a minute-by-minute horizon, a vision that may later benefit electromagnetic transient simulation or stability co-simulation tools, in horizons from the microsecond to the second.},

In this article, the real supervision, control, and data acquisition (SCADA) system of CPES is integrated with the advanced techniques—real-time simulation (RTS) and power-hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL), in a cross-infrastructure manner to create a realistic validation environment for CPES. On the one hand, the method can be applied to extend the capacity of the infrastructures as well as creating a common resource and expertise pool. On the other hand, this approach combines the realistic data and advanced SCADA services with the flexibility of the RTS platform, which provides the possibility to emulate extreme and faulty scenarios with virtual equipment and topology. The proposed approach is demonstrated via a case study of analyzing the impact of communication on advanced voltage and frequency restoration in an isolated microgrid. The case study is implemented on two remote platforms PREDIS-PRISMES (70 km apart).

	doi = {10.1109/TIA.2020.3023669},
	abstract = {With the ongoing automation driven by the push toward the smart electric grid and the advancement in associated cyber infrastructure, the interaction between physical [electric transmission and distribution (T\$\&\$D) systems], cyber (communication, automation, and control), and human (grid operators and decision-makers) is increasingly becoming more complex. This creates the requirement of analyzing the effect of the transmission system on the distribution system and vice versa with consideration of the additional complexity of the cyber infrastructure. Such an integrated testbed will also help with resiliency analysis, where resiliency refers to the ability of the system to continue serving energy to the critical loads even with limited extreme contingencies. Interaction of the physical power grid with the cyber layer can be effectively modeled using real-time (RT) simulator for developing and validating various operational and control algorithms. Testbeds using RT simulators with multiple capabilities have been developed at different institutions. Still, no single existing testbed can offer full scalability while simultaneously meeting high fidelity requirements for resiliency experimentation. Co-simulating federated testbed assets can provide a scalable experimentation platform that can be leveraged for verification and validation. In this article, an architecture is developed for federated cyber-physical testbed. A local federation with two real-time simulators is developed: real-time digital simulator (RTDS) and OPAL-RT have been interfaced using VILLAS framework for end-to-end testing. Also, a real-time linear predictor is developed and integrated here to address the communication latency impact on geographically allocated federated RT simulation. Finally, resiliency analysis tools are formulated and utilized for T\$\&\$D systems. As an illustrative use case, the resiliency of a T\$\&\$D test system is simulated, and the results are analyzed. A 179-bus Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) transmission system is developed using OPAL-RT/ HYPERSIM, and a modified IEEE 13 node feeder system is modeled in RTDS/RSCAD and interfaced for resiliency analysis.},

	abstract = {The increasing complexity of power systems has warranted the development of geographically distributed real-time simulations (GD-RTS). However, the wide scale adoption of GD-RTS remains a challenge owing to the (i) limitations of state-of-the-art interfaces in reproducing faster dynamics and transients, (ii) lack of an approach to ensure a successful implementation within geographically separated research infrastructures (RIs) and (iii) lack of established evidence of its appropriateness for smart grid applications. To address the limitations in reproduction of faster dynamics and transients, this study presents a synchronous reference frame interface for GD-RTS. By means of a comprehensive performance characterisation, the superior performance of the proposed interface in terms of accuracy (reduced error on average by 60\% and faster settling times) and computational complexity has been established. This study further derives the transfer function models for GD-RTS with interface characteristics for analytical stability analysis that ensure stable implementations avoiding the risks associated with multiple RI implementations. Finally, to establish confidence in the proposed interface and to investigate GD-RTS applicability for real-world applications, a GD-RTS implementation between two RIs at the University of Strathclyde is realised to demonstrate inertial support within transmission network model of the Great Britain power system.},

Before running the actual thermo-electric co-simulation, a loop-back test was designed and run to investigate the accuracy, latency, and stability of the communication link.

This paper aims to establish a link between two different geographically distributed simulators into a real-time simulation, by means of the co-simulation environment OpSim.

The platform is distributed, real-time capable, allows for easy internet-based connection from geographically-dispersed participants, and is software platform agnostic. The authors demonstrate its utility by studying real-time PHIL co-simulation of coordinated solar photovoltaic (PV) firming control of two inverters connected in multiple electric distribution network models, prototypical of US and Australian systems. The novel trans-pacific closed-loop system simulation was conducted in real time using a power network simulator and physical PV/battery inverter at power at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, CO, USA and a physical PV inverter at power at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's Energy Centre in Newcastle, NSW, Australia.

	abstract = {Interconnection of digital real-time simulators over wide-area communication networks is an innovative approach to extend local real-time simulation capabilities to enable large-scale simulations. Furthermore, it allows the integration of geographically distributed assets as Power Hardware-in-the-Loop and Controller Hardware-in-the-Loop, thus providing a flexible framework for performing unique research experiments. In most cases, it is not possible to perform large scale real-time simulations and comprehensive experiments locally due to lack of simulation capacity and unavailability of unique assets. Main challenge associated with geographically distributed real-time simulation is to ensure simulation fidelity of the same degree as in the case when the entire simulation is performed at the same location. Simulation fidelity in geographically distributed real-time simulation is investigated and an empirical characterization is provided in this paper. Fidelity degradation caused by different values of time delay and sending rate of data exchange between two digital real-time simulators is presented. Two methods for representation of interface quantities in co-simulation interface algorithms are considered for performing simulations. The first method is based on representation of interface quantities as root mean square of magnitude, frequency, and phase angle of the current and voltage waveforms. The second method utilizes representation of interface quantities in form of time-varying Fourier coefficients, known as dynamic phasors. The empirical study is performed for transmission-distribution co-simulation using two racks of Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS®).},

GridSpice seamlessly integrates existing electric power simulation tools to enable modeling of large electric networks that blur the boundaries between generation, transmission, distribution, and markets. This is achieved via a cloud-based architecture that allows for parallelizing large simulation jobs across many virtual machines using a pay-as-you-go model. GridSpice simulations can be managed through a Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API), or through a Python library, allowing users to run simulations programmatically and interface with disparate data inputs, energy management systems (EMS), distribution management systems (DMS), and postprocessing tools. These capabilities make GridSpice an ideal tool for the development and testing of new grid control and optimization algorithms. GridSpice also provides an easy-to-use browser-based interface to allow novice users to begin without any setup or configuration on their local PC. A first implementation of the GridSpice framework integrates Gridlab-D and MATPOWER as simulation tools, and has been used for projects including optimizing the placement of distributed generation and developing optimal dispatch schedules for flexible loads.

Rather than analyzing the Real Time Simulator (RTS) data and controlling the interface using time-domain resonant controllers, the RTS data will be analyzed and controlled at the interface in the frequency domain, on a harmonic-by-harmonic and phase-by-phase basis. This should allow the RTS time delay to be compensated accurately, and removes the requirement to include additional components to compensate for the simulation delay into the simulated power system as it is not appropriate for power systems which have short transmission lines.

Coupling different models and simulations in a co-simulation allows for studying the complex behavior of smart grids or similar complex systems. One particular problem in such a scenario is the way the coupling is performed: this paper presents a reliable REST based web interface, to successfully couple simulations through standardized interfaces that are widely used in the internet. We are showing its capabilities and how disconnects are handled. Two applications are presented, demonstrating the versatility as well as the limits of such an interface.},

Especially for energy systems integration simulations involving different physical domains, co-simulation is the required approach. However, co-simulation setup is complex, time-consuming, and additionally, error-prone for large simulations, especially if visualizations are included. Therefore, for an intensive information exchange between simulators, the present paper introduces a new network-based communication concept including the co-simulation setup procedure. The proposed setup concept enables an efficient configuration for the coupling of distributed simulation modules. The evaluation of the implemented concept on an exemplary power grid simulation with integration of power-to-gas and gas-to-power components and power grid visualization shows the ability for efficient handling of a high amount of exchanged simulation data.},

It serves the verifying of a stable operation of developed energy systems infrastructure, before it comes to the realization. As energy systems integration becomes an important part in a low carbon energy scenario in the future, the cooperation of experts specialized in various domains crucial to single aspects of the energy system is indispensable. Cosimulation, yet, enables the modelling in the familiar environment of the experts, but requires a detailed coordination of the simulation interfaces between the specific expert models. Hence, standardized interfaces are crucial to the efficient use of expert knowledge in distributed co-simulations. Therefore, in the presented paper a workflow for the co-simulation development of energy systems simulations, which simplifies the coordination procedure significantly by standardizing the interfaces between the models and their simulations, is introduced. The approach is exemplarily applied to the energy system design of a district comprising electricity and heat in order to show its successful performance.},

	abstract = {Virtual system development gets more and more important in many industrial domains. It is considered to reduce development times, lower computing costs, and shorten time-to-market. Co-simulation is a particularly promising approach for modular and interoperable development. In practice the integration and coupling of heterogeneous systems still require enormous efforts. The configuration and operation of distributed hardware-in-the-loop systems and simulations contribute to efficiency of testing. Currently no standardized interface or protocol specification is available, which allows the interaction of real-time and non-real-time systems of different vendors. This paper for the first time presents the Distributed Co-simulation Protocol (DCP) which is subject to proposal as a standard for real-time and non-real-time system integration and simulation. The DCP consists of a data model, a finite state machine, and a communication protocol including a set of protocol data units. It is designed as a tool independent standard. It was developed in context of the ACOSAR project and is subject to standardization as a Modelica Association Project (MAP). It enables the definition, configuration and execution of a wide range of different simulations and test scenarios. It supports a master-slave architecture for simulation setup and control. The specification defines the design of a slave only, the design of a master is not in scope of the specification. To highlight the industrial applicability of the DCP, three examples from the automotive domain are shown.},

The optimization engine receives the AMI data stream through measurement aggregators.

To check the performance and the precision of proposed VVO, a fault scenario is imposed upon the system.

The objective for the development of the simulation platform is to provide a tool that supports the design of control and energy management algorithms for those systems. The platform allows long-term simulations of a large number of buildings, including internal energy supply or energy conversion systems, in combination with external energy supply systems like the electrical grid. The simulation of those physical systems represents the environment for sophisticated control and energy management algorithms that can be tested on the platform. The concept of this work is to combine commercial-off-the-shelf software packages, here simulators and runtime infrastructure (RTI), to a high performance multidomain cosimulation platform. The high performance of the platform regarding computation time has been achieved by exploiting the parallel computing capabilities of modern simulation servers. Especially the computation time of large numbers of instances of Modelica-based models has been reduced significantly by the development of the parallel execution framework (PEF). The implementation of the PEF, including the interface to the individual models and to the RTI, is described in detail. The partitioning of the simulated system among different simulators does not influence the simulation results, as shown on the basis of a small-scale simulation scenario. The performance regarding the computation time is demonstrated on several example simulation scenarios showing the scalability of the platform.},

	abstract = {Power systems and especially Smart Grids increasingly apply Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for exchanging information over wide area networks. Here, the performance of the ICT has become crucial for the development of new Wide Area Monitoring, Protection And Control (WAMPAC) [1] systems. In this context, simulations are a common way for evaluation, but power systems and communication networks are usually analysed with dedicated simulators. Therefore a combined simulation for analysing the dynamics and mutual impacts of both domains is needed. In this paper we present a generic hybrid simulation architecture based on the IEEE standard 1516 - High Level Architecture [2] to enable a combined simulation of power systems and communication networks in an integrated simulation environment. First, we introduce our hybrid simulator architecture, along with the communication and synchronization process between sub-simulators. Secondly, we present our communication networks architecture for modelling the network traffic caused by the information transmitted by control and protection algorithms within the electrical transmission system. Finally, we introduce our modelling approach for mapping entities between the power systems and the communication networks. For this purpose, we introduce our concept of a Substation Data Processing Unit, which represents entities on substation level by providing an IEC 61850 [3] based model for mapping logical functions for local process control, implementing decentralized protection and control algorithms and providing additional components for the power systems (e.g Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) [4]).},

	abstract = {Evaluation of the smart grid in the presence of dynamic market-based pricing and complex networks of small and large producers, consumers, and distributers is a very difficult task. It not only involves multiple, interacting, heterogeneous cyber-physical domains, but also requires tight integration of power markets, dynamic pricing and transactions, and price-sensitive consumer behavior, where consumers can also be producers of power. These dynamics introduce a huge challenge of maintaining stability of the power grid. Moreover, evolving business models and regulatory environment, including human factors need to be a key part of the evaluation as they directly affect the demand-response in the grid. Furthermore, as sensors and computations are becoming more distributed on edge devices and as they often employ normal communication channels, cyber security of the critical power grid infrastructure has become ever more important to prevent cyber intrusions and attack. Current research has largely focused on one or a few of these challenges and the simulation tools developed cater to these individual tasks, such as network simulators, power distribution simulators, or human or organization and policy simulators. However, to attain a deeper understanding of the transactive grid behavior, analysis of grid stability, and to optimize resources both from consumers', and generators' perspective, a comprehensive platform is needed to facilitate end-to-end evaluation of all of these aspects. This paper describes an open platform that provides a coherent framework for integrated transactive energy simulations of smart grids and is readily customizable and extensible for various simulation tools.},

	abstract = {Distributed simulation is desirable at many levels of system design. Modeling and simulation of large complex systems, remote monitoring and control, and nondestructive remote testing of devices are three examples of the many applications in which both distributed and realtime distributed simulation are advantageous. Distributed simulation reduces simulation complexity by allowing the partitioning of a large complex system into two or more smaller subsystems. In addition, distributed simulation permits computational resource sharing and enables teamwork. The Virtual Test Bed (VTB) and its real-time extension, VTB-RT, have been adapted to deal with distributed simulation in both non-real-time and real-time. Efforts at Mississippi State University and the University of South Carolina have made possible the addition of models for distributed simulation to the VTB model library to handle both natural and signal coupling at the decoupling point. The focus of these efforts has been on the algorithms used to enforce simulation stability and energy conservation in a distributed environment. Implementation issues related to the different communication architectures used in distributed simulation environments are only briefly discussed in this paper. The models for distributed simulation described in this paper are implemented using a simple remote procedure call communication scheme, which is sufficient to demonstrate the proposed algorithms. Several examples presented in this paper demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the developed VTB models.},

This test bed for distributed integration enables utilities to study the impacts of emerging energy technologies on their system and manufacturers to explore the interactions of new devices with existing and emerging devices on the power system, both without the need to convert existing grid models to a new platform or to conduct in-field trials. This paper describes an implementation of this architecture for testing two residential-scale advanced solar inverters at separate points of common coupling (PCCs). The same hardware setup is tested with two different distribution feeders (IEEE 123 and 8500 node test systems) modeled using GridLAB-D. In addition to simplifying testing with multiple feeders, the architecture demonstrates additional flexibility with hardware testing in one location linked via the Internet to software modeling in a remote location. In testing, the inverter current, real and reactive power, and PCC voltage are well captured by the cosimulation platform. Testing of the inverter advanced control features is currently somewhat limited by the software model time step (1 s) and tested communication latency (24 ms). These limitations could be overcome using faster modeling and communication within the same cosimulation architecture.},

RT-PHIL emulation offers a realistic, controlled, and easily reconfigurable test environment for analyzing grid integration problems, in which classic tools frequently show a lack of capacity. The proposed discrete-time models and implementation methodology result in creation of platform-independent models suitable for application on any RT platform. A voltage-source converter is used as PHIL power interface between the RT simulation and a microgrid testbed. This test environment is of interest for verification of high-level control strategies for wind farms and for evaluation of the response of hardware systems, such as active filters or static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) connected to a grid (or microgrid) in presence of wind power generation.

Parts of larger systems are, however, typically modeled and simulated by different techniques, tools, and algorithms. In addition, experts from different disciplines use various modeling and simulation techniques. Both these facts make it difficult to study coupled heterogeneous systems. Co-simulation is an emerging enabling technique, where global simulation of a coupled system can be achieved by composing the simulations of its parts. Due to its potential and interdisciplinary nature, co-simulation is being studied in different disciplines but with limited sharing of findings. In this survey, we study and survey the state-of-the-art techniques for co-simulation, with the goal of enhancing future research and highlighting the main challenges. To study this broad topic, we start by focusing on discrete-event-based co-simulation, followed by continuous-time-based co-simulation. Finally, we explore the interactions between these two paradigms, in hybrid co-simulation. To survey the current techniques, tools, and research challenges, we systematically classify recently published research literature on co-simulation, and summarize it into a taxonomy. As a result, we identify the need for finding generic approaches for modular, stable, and accurate coupling of simulation units, as well as expressing the adaptations required to ensure that the coupling is correct.},

	abstract = {An important goal of smart grid is to leverage modern digital communication infrastructure to help control power systems more effectively. As more and more Internet of Things (IoT) devices with measurement and/or control capability are designed and deployed for a more stable and efficient power system, the role of communication network has become more important. To evaluate the performance of control algorithms for inter-dependent power grid and communication network, a test bed that could simulate inter-dependent power grid and communication network is desirable. In this paper, we demonstrate the design and implementation of a novel co-simulator, which would effectively evaluate IoT-aided algorithms for scheduling the jobs of electrical appliances. There are three major features of our co-simulator: 1) large-scale test is achieved by distributed modules that are designed based on a Turing-indistinguishable approach; 2) remote servers or test devices are controlled by local graphical user interface (we only need to configure the simulator on a local server); 3) a software virtual network approach is employed to emulate real networks, which significantly reduces the cost of real-world test beds. To evaluate our co-simulator, two energy consumption scheduling algorithms are implemented. Experimental results show that our co-simulator could effectively evaluate these methods. Thus our co-simulator is a powerful tool for utility companies and policy makers to commission novel IoT devices or methods in future smart grid infrastructure.},

	abstract = {Simulations become more and more crucial in the field of future energy systems. This is caused by the increasing complexity of energy systems that consist of a variety of subsystems such as supply infrastructures, production, consumption, markets, communication, meteorology etc. Co-simulation tools provide the possibility to combine models of these subsystems and run them in a coordinated simulation. However, such simulations become more and more complex, making it improbable that the user of a simulation is the same person that develops the simulation system. To facilitate the communication between users and developers of co-simulation tools and to help the user to find the suitable software for his purpose, the authors suggest a typification of co-simulation tools. This is done by identifying the most relevant attributes each specified by a set of possible configurations. The utilization of the developed schemed is demonstrated by applying it to the mosaik co-simulation framework.},

In order to understand this coupling, cyber physical test bed can help to model and simulate the smart grid with sufficient level of detail. In this chapter, an introduction to the smart electric grid and the challenges associated with the development of cyber-power test bed is presented.

A high-performance real-time simulation environment is necessary to obtain high-fidelity results in HIL simulations. This paper presents the detailed implementation of a very-low-cost multisolver hard real-time simulation environment, namely the real-time extension of the virtual test bed (VTB-RT). VTB-RT is implemented completely from open-source software and off-the-shelf hardware. Using VTB-RT, this paper proposes an efficient real-time HIL testing approach for control designs in power electronics applications. VTB-RT enables the natural coupling between the simulation environment and the hardware under test and, thus, makes virtual power exchange in HIL simulation possible. For validation purposes, the proposed real-time HIL testing approach is applied in two well-known power electronics application examples, namely a boost converter and an H-bridge inverter with their respective control systems, representing a very-low-cost and a relatively advanced hardware setup, respectively. The consistency of the experimental results with the theoretical results proves the applicability of VTB-RT and the proposed testing approach. Finally, the most recent research progresses in VTB-RT are summarized},

	abstract = {In this paper, a thermo-electric co-simulation of an all-electric ship type notional system using two geographically distributed heterogeneous real-time simulators is presented. The two real-time simulators, from RTDS and OPAL-RT, are used for modeling the electrical system and the thermal system of an all-electric ship, respectively. RTDS is located at the Center for Advanced Power Systems, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, USA whereas the OPAL-RT simulator is located in the RTX-Lab at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. The two simulators separated by approximately 3500 km, exchange data through an asynchronous link over the Internet utilizing the TCP/IP and UDP protocols. The electrical model was developed using RSCAD and simulated on RTDS while the thermal model was developed using SIMULINK and simulated in the RT-LAB environment. RTDS sends the electrical power losses to the OPAL-RT simulator, which computes the temperatures of the thermal systems and sends the data back to the RTDS simulator. Simulation results indicate that despite the large physical distance between the two simulators, the co-simulation is accurate and stable. A low latency of 0.208 s was observed which is within acceptable limits for a slow system response expected from the thermal system, which has time constants in the range of seconds. Results indicate that co-simulation of different types of systems is a viable and may be a cost-effective option to perform remote hardware-in-the-loop simulation of complex multi-engineering models.},

Moreover, the HLA enables computational performance by distributed execution of each simulator on its own hardware and, thus, the applicability to realistic large-scale scenarios. INSPIRE has been designed under consideration of industrial standards [IEC 61850,object linking and embedding (OLE) for process control (OPC), and the common information model (CIM) (IEC 61968/61970)] in order to enhance interoperability, and to develop and validate solutions close to practice.

	abstract = {The main goal of the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard is to allow the sharing of simulation models across tools. To accomplish this, FMI relies on a combination of XML-files and compiled C-code packaged in a zip archive. This archive is called a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU). In theory, an FMU can support multiple platforms, but not necessarily in practice. Furthermore, software libraries for interacting with FMUs may not be available in a particular language or platform. Another issue is related to the protection of intellectual property (IP). While an FMU is free to only provide the C-code in its binary form, other resources within the FMU may be unprotected. Distributing models in binary form also opens up the possibility that they may contain malicious code. In order to meet these challenges, this paper presents an open-source co-simulation framework based on FMI, which is language and platform independent thanks to the use of well-established remote procedure call (RPC) technologies. One or more FMUs are wrapped inside a server program supporting one or more language independent RPC systems over various network protocols. Together, they allow cross-platform invocation of FMUs from multiple, including previously unsupported, languages. The client-server architecture allows the effective protection of IP while also providing a means of protecting users from malicious code.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a cyber-physical framework for investigating distributed control systems operating in the context of smart-grid applications. At the moment, the literature focuses almost exclusively on the theoretical aspects of distributed intelligence in the smart-grid, meanwhile, approaches for testing and validating such systems are either missing or are very limited in their scope. Three aspects need to be taken into account while considering these applications: (1) the physical system, (2) the distributed computation platform, and (3) the communication system. In most of the previous works either the communication system is neglected or oversimplified, either the distributed computation aspect is disregarded, either both elements are missing. In order to cover all these aspects, we propose a framework which is built around a fleet of low-cost single board computers coupled with a real-time simulator. Additionally, using traffic control and network emulation, the flow of data between different controllers is shaped so that it replicates various quality of service (QoS) conditions. The versatility of the proposed framework is shown on a study case in which 27 controllers self-coordinate in order to solve the distributed optimal power flow (OPF) algorithm in a dc network.},

The requirements on a research infrastructure (RI) to cope with the trends of such a dynamic system therefore grow in size, diversity and costs, making the feasibility of rigorous advancements questionable by a single RI. Analysis of large scale system complexity has been made possible by the real-time coupling of geographically separated RIs undertaking geographically distributed simulations (GDS), the concept of which brings the equipment, models and expertise of independent RIs, in combination, to optimally address the challenge. This paper presents the outputs of IEEE PES Task Force on Interfacing Techniques for Simulation Tools towards standardization of GDS as a concept. First, the taxonomy for setups utilized for GDS is established followed by a comprehensive overview of the advancements in real-time couplings reported in literature. The overview encompasses fundamental technological design considerations for GDS. The paper further presents four application oriented case studies (real-world implementations) where GDS setups have been utilized, demonstrating their practicality and potential in enabling the analysis of future complex power systems.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a distributed, real-time platform for aerospace power system design, testing and evaluation, which was developed by the University of Dayton, in partnership with GE Aviation's Electrical Power Integrated Systems Center (EPIS Center). This platform is based upon heterogeneous distributed, real-time computing hardware. Also, high-fidelity, physics-based or behavioral models can capture a variety of electro-magnetic transients, electro-mechanical dynamics, aerodynamics, control and thermal dynamics at different time scales, and allow for fault studies as well. A set of real-time computational solvers are used to find the solution to system simulation in a parallel manner, which can help optimize the computational load and simulation step. A simulation time-step as low as 100 nanoseconds can be achieved on the real-time simulator for the model to capture very fast electromagnetic transients, which is especially beneficial for more-electric aircraft where fast-switching power electronic devices dominate. Multiple simulators can be connected together to simulate the integrated operation of multiple systems such as electrical power systems, engines and propulsion systems, and avionics. This paper also elaborates on the various stages of product development and certification for which this platform can be used: real-time simulation, hardware-in-the-loop testing, power hardware-in-the-loop testing and pilot-in-the-loop testing. Two examples of model development and validation and some selected testing results will also be presented in the paper.},

The proposed architecture is based on a cloud solution, which allows the communication with the smart meters from one side and provides the needed interfaces to the distribution grid services on the other one.

In order to analyze the impact of various factors on the system performance and reduce the potential risk, it is advantageous to establish a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) real-time simulation platform for MEA. From this purpose, some key processes are suggested to clear the way for an efficient and accurate design. First, the principles of system partitioning and high-performance communication network are presented for distributed parallel computation. Then, algorithms are discussed and compared aiming to compensate inter-simulation time-step switching error caused by high-frequency switches which are widely used in MEA. Finally, an automation test method based on Monte Carlo (MC) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) methodology is proposed. In the experimental part, a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) in HIL mode is presented to demonstrate the practicality, with the results of the offline and real-time simulation compared. In short, this paper provides a guidance for establishing an HIL platform for LSCES.},

The two real-time simulators, from RTDS and OPAL-RT, are used for modeling the electrical system and the thermal system of an all-electric ship, respectively. RTDS is located at the Center for Advanced Power Systems, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, USA whereas the OPAL-RT simulator is located in the RTX-Lab at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. The two simulators separated by approximately 3500 km, exchange data through an asynchronous link over the Internet utilizing the TCP/IP and UDP protocols. The electrical model was developed using RSCAD and simulated on RTDS while the thermal model was developed using SIMULINK and simulated in the RT-LAB environment. RTDS sends the electrical power losses to the OPAL-RT simulator, which computes the temperatures of the thermal systems and sends the data back to the RTDS simulator. Simulation results indicate that despite the large physical distance between the two simulators, the co-simulation is accurate and stable. A low latency of 0.208 s was observed which is within acceptable limits for a slow system response expected from the thermal system, which has time constants in the range of seconds. Results indicate that co-simulation of different types of systems is a viable and may be a cost-effective option to perform remote hardware-in-the-loop simulation of complex multi-engineering models.},

This paper presents a feasibility study of geographically distributed real-time simulation realized through the connection of two OPAL-RT real-time digital simulators, located at SINTEF (Trondheim, Norway) and ACS (RWTH Aachen University, Germany). A simple HVDC point to point link that connects two AC systems is adopted here as a study.},

However, power systems are usually highly complex and distributed, thus system partitioning has to be used to allow for sharing resources in simulation. At Mississippi State University, researchers are developing distributed simulations of power system models using an electromagnetic transient simulator, namely RTDS. The goal is to demonstrate and assess the feasibility of both non-real-time and real-time simulations using the RTDS in a geographically distributed scenario. RTDS has the capability of sending and receiving digital data in a local area network using a special interface known as GTNET. In this work the RTDS is used in a wide area network for sending and receiving data. The different protocols and options used in the RTDS communication between power system models will be studied and analyzed.},

Main challenges associated with establishing GD-RTS environment are ensuring simulation stability and providing simulation fidelity of high degree. The issue of designing a cosimulation Interface Algorithm (IA) that meets these requirements is closely related to the bilateral teleoperation concept in robotics. In this work we analyze applicability of wave variables, one of the most widely used method for bilateral teleoperation. Wave variables ensure simulation stability in presence of large time delays.

A simple and cost-effective power interface, paired with a remotely located Digital Real-time Simulator (DRTS), facilitates Geographically Distributed Power Hardware Loop (GD-PHiL) in a quasi-static operating regime. In this study, a DRTS simulator was interfaced via the public internet with a grid-forming ship-to-shore converter located in a smart-grid testing laboratory, approximately 40 km away from the simulator. A case study based on the IEEE 13-bus distribution network, an on-load-tap-changer (OLTC) controller and a controllable load in the laboratory demonstrated the feasibility of such a setup. A simple compensation method applicable to this multi-rate setup is proposed and evaluated. Experimental results indicate that this compensation method significantly enhances the voltage response, whereas the conservation of energy at the coupling point still poses a challenge. Findings also show that, due to inherent limitations of the converter\&rsquo;s Modbus interface, a separate measurement setup is preferable. This can help achieve higher measurement fidelity, while simultaneously increasing the loop rate of the PHiL setup.},

Due to the bidirectional exchange between virtual and physical systems, a true-to-reality interface is essential; however, linking several dynamic systems, stability issues can challenge the experiments, the components under test, and the individuals performing the experiments. Over the time, several interface algorithms (IA) have been developed and analyzed, each having different advantages and disadvantages in view of combining virtual simulations with physical power systems. Finally, IA are very specific to the kind of PHIL experiment. This paper investigates the operational range of several IA for specific PHIL setups by calculations, simulations, and measurements. Therefore, a selection of the mainly used respectively optimized IA is mathematically described. The operational range is verified in a PHIL system testing environment. Furthermore, in order to study the influence of different PHIL setups, according to software and hardware impedance, different tests using linear and switching amplifiers are performed.},

The time step is of particular interest since the communication delay between simulators interconnected through wide area network is much larger than the simulation time step typically used in electromagnetic transient real-time simulations. However, commercially available real-time simulators use either the electromagnetic transient or classic complex phasor representation. Results in the dynamic phasor and electromagnetic transient domain are compared to quantify the advantage of dynamic phasor simulations in practice.

	doi = {10.1109/SEDST.2015.7315271},
	abstract = {In PHIL simulations different time delays are introduced. Although it can be reduced, there is always some time delay. As a consequence, when the device under test is part of a low impedance power system such as: microgrids, marine or aero power systems, the simulation process becomes challenging due to the poor accuracy of the results achieved by the introduction of the time delay. Therefore, in order to accurately compensate for the inherent time delay introduced in Power Hardware in the Loop (PHIL) simulations, a method based on phase-shifting the reference voltage signal harmonic-by-harmonic and phase-by-phase is proposed. In this manner the time delay compensation will not affect to the system topology and therefore the dynamic behaviour of the original system will stay as it originally was in terms of power angles and V-I phase relationships for all the harmonics processed. In this paper, an experiment where the reference voltage is altered with 5th and 7th harmonics shows that the accuracy of PHIL simulations after the application of this compensation method is greatly improved compared with traditional methods. As a result, low impedance power systems are now able to experience an accurate PHIL simulation.},

	abstract = {Real-time simulation is an increasingly popular tool for product development and research in power systems. However, commercial simulators are still quite exclusive due to their costs and they face problems in bridging the gap between two common types of power system simulation, conventional phasor based, and electromagnetic transient simulation. This work describes recent improvements to the open source real-time simulator DPsim to address increasingly important use cases that involve power electronics that are connected to the electrical grid and increasing grid sizes. New power electronic models have been developed and integrated into the DPsim simulator together with techniques to decouple the system solution, which facilitate parallelization. The results show that the dynamic phasors in DPsim, which result from shifted frequency analysis, allow the user to combine the characteristics of conventional phasor and electromagnetic transient simulation. Besides, simulation speed up techniques that are known from the electromagnetic domain and new techniques, specific to dynamic phasors, significantly improve the performance. It demonstrates the advantages of dynamic phasor simulation for future power systems and the applicability of this concept to large scale scenarios.},

	abstract = {Simulation of power system behavior is a highly useful tool for planning, analysis of stability, and operator training. Traditionally, small power system studies are dominated by the time taken to solve the machine dynamics equations, while larger studies are dominated by the time taken to solve the network equations. With the trend towards more sophisticated and realistic modeling, the size and complexity of simulations of a power system grow tremendously. The ever-increasing need for computational power can be satisfied by the application of distributed simulation. Also power systems are distributed in nature. The terrestrial power systems are divided into groups and controlled by different Regional Transmission Organization (RTO). Each RTO owns the detailed parameter for the area under control, but only limited data and boundary measurement of the external network. Thus, performing power system analysis in such case is a challenge. Also, simulating a large-scale power system with detailed modeling of the components causes a heavy computational burden. One possible way of relieving this problem is to decouple the network into subsystems and solve the subsystem respectively, and then combine the results of the subsystems to get the solution. The way to decouple a network and represent the missing part will affect the result greatly. Also, due to information distribution in the dispatch centers, a problem of doing power system analysis with limited data available arises. The equivalents for other networks need to be constructed to analyze power system. In this research work, a distributed simulation algorithm is proposed to handle the issues above. A history of distributed simulation is briefly introduced. A generalized coupling method dealing with natural coupling is proposed. Distributed simulation models are developed and demonstrated in Virtual Test Bed (VTB). The models are tested with different network configurations. The test results are presented and analyzed. The performance of the distributed simulation is compared with the steady state result and time domain simulation result. Satisfactory results are achieved.},

Geographically distributed real-time simulation (GD-RTS) environment established by virtual interconnection of Digital Real-Time Simulators (DRTS) located at geographically dispersed laboratories allows for holistic testing of novel devices and concepts. Main challenges associated with establishing GD-RTS environment are ensuring simulation stability and providing simulation fidelity of high degree. The issue of designing a cosimulation Interface Algorithm (IA) that meets these requirements is closely related to the bilateral teleoperation concept in robotics. In this work we analyze applicability of wave variables, one of the most widely used method for bilateral teleoperation. Wave variables ensure simulation stability in presence of large time delays. Simulation fidelity of IA has been improved by introducing transformation of wave variables to dynamic phasor domain.},
